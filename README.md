## Texas Breweries
### Objective 
Create an application to allow users to search breweries. 

### Brief 
We have a business requirement to regularly collect Texas brewery data and store it in our own back-end system.  

### Tasks 
Implement assignment using one of the following technologies: 
* C# / .NET 
* Java 
* React / Redux 
* Python / Django 
* NodeJS 

Your application should persist all Texas breweries in a database.<br>
Create a Brewery model that persists all fields returned from the brewery API response.<br> 
Create a UI that shows all Texas breweries in a table.<br> 
If you have extra time, decide how to show the breweries in a more useful way to an end user. 

### Note 
You are NOT required to implement an authentication system. Assume each request is coming from the same user. Assume the API is only consumed by you and your own application. The API endpoints do not need to be RESTful, and using regular, framework rendered HTML is perfectly fine.

### Evaluation Criteria
* Clean code best practices 
* If you are using a framework, make sure best practices are followed 
* Show us your work through your commit history 
* Completeness: did you complete the features? 
* Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
* Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way? 

### Homework Submission 
Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes a public Github repository. Be prepared to share your repository ahead of the interview.
